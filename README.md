Desktop version of SiempreVideo

## Running

First, create a folder `/build` in the root directory of this project

Then, `npm install` to setup everything.

And then `npm run start` to open dev version. Then there's some other stuff in
the `package.json` scripts to package it together, I forget how to do that.

All the electron stuff is in `public/electron.js`
